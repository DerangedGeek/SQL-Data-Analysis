# SQL-Data-Analysis
Here I did a guided analysis, with Data with Baraa,  to clean through data and then find the following data: Total sales, total quantity sold, average order revenue, how recent a client was, and the everage monthly revenue. Some other insights were also pulled from the database.  I chose to upload just the second part only.
